ARCHITECT DIRECTIVE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST:

‚úÖ BEFORE CREATING ANYTHING NEW:
1. Check if it already exists to avoid duplicates
2. Verify it connects to EventBus (no isolated functions)
3. Ensure it uses real data (no mock/dummy data)
4. Confirm it's registered in system_tree.json
5. Verify telemetry hooks are connected

‚úÖ DURING EXECUTION:
1. Load build_status.json, build_tracker.md, system_tree.json
2. Validate all modules are connected (no orphans)
3. Check EventBus routes (no isolated functions)
4. Scan for duplicates and propose deletions
5. Detect gaps in logic and fix immediately
6. Update build_status.json after every step
7. Document progress in build_tracker.md

‚úÖ PERFORMANCE MAINTAINED:
- No background processes
- No file watchers
- Minimal CPU/memory impact
- Guardian-free environment preserved

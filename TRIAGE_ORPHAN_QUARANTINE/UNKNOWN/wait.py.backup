# How should we wait on sockets?
#
# There are two types of APIs you can use for waiting on sockets: the fancy
# modern stateful APIs like epoll/kqueue, and the older stateless APIs like
# select/poll. The stateful APIs are more efficient when you have a lots of
# sockets to keep track of, because you can set them up once and then use them
# lots of times. But we only ever want to wait on a single socket at a time
# and don't want to keep track of state, so the stateless APIs are actually
# more efficient. So we want to use select() or poll().
#
# Now, how do we choose between select() and poll()? On traditional Unixes,
# select() has a strange calling convention that makes it slow, or fail
# altogether, for high-numbered file descriptors. The point of poll() is to fix
# that, so on Unixes, we prefer poll().
#
# On Windows, there is no poll() (or at least Python doesn't provide a wrapper
# for it), but that's OK, because on Windows, select() doesn't have this
# strange calling convention; plain select() works fine.
#
# So: on Windows we use select(), and everywhere else we use poll(). We also
# fall back to select() in case poll() is somehow broken or missing.

JPEG quality settings equivalent to the Photoshop settings.
Can be used when saving JPEG files.

The following presets are available by default:
``web_low``, ``web_medium``, ``web_high``, ``web_very_high``, ``web_maximum``,
``low``, ``medium``, ``high``, ``maximum``.
More presets can be added to the :py:data:`presets` dict if needed.

To apply the preset, specify::

  quality="preset_name"

To apply only the quantization table::

  qtables="preset_name"

To apply only the subsampling setting::

  subsampling="preset_name"

Example::

  im.save("image_name.jpg", quality="web_high")

Subsampling
-----------

Subsampling is the practice of encoding images by implementing less resolution
for chroma information than for luma information.
(ref.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling)

Possible subsampling values are 0, 1 and 2 that correspond to 4:4:4, 4:2:2 and
4:2:0.

You can get the subsampling of a JPEG with the
:func:`.JpegImagePlugin.get_sampling` function.

In JPEG compressed data a JPEG marker is used instead of an EXIF tag.
(ref.: https://exiv2.org/tags.html)


Quantization tables
-------------------

They are values use by the DCT (Discrete cosine transform) to remove
*unnecessary* information from the image (the lossy part of the compression).
(ref.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_matrix#Quantization_matrices,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Quantization)

You can get the quantization tables of a JPEG with::

  im.quantization

This will return a dict with a number of lists. You can pass this dict
directly as the qtables argument when saving a JPEG.

The quantization table format in presets is a list with sublists. These formats
are interchangeable.

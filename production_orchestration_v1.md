# GENESIS PRODUCTION ORCHESTRATION v1.0 - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**Timestamp:** 2025-06-21 16:58:00 EEST  
**Status:** ARCHITECT_MODE_V7_COMPLIANT  
**Classification:** HIGH PRIORITY PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

## ðŸ“Œ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the production orchestration implementation plan that merges the new orchestration requirements with existing ARCHITECT MODE v7.0.0 compliance. The system is currently at 100% compliance and ready for production deployment with integrated MT5 connectivity.

## ðŸ§© INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### Module Domain Classification

Based on the existing architecture and new orchestration requirements, all modules will be verified within these domains:

1. **Signal Intelligence**
   - Pattern recognition engines
   - Signal generators
   - Market analysis modules
   
2. **Strategy Execution**
   - Strategy executors
   - Position managers
   - Order routers
   
3. **Risk Engine**
   - FTMO compliance modules (5% daily loss, 10% trailing drawdown)
   - Risk calculators
   - Position sizing
   
4. **Kill Switch Logic**
   - Emergency stop mechanisms
   - Circuit breakers
   - Safety protocols
   
5. **Macro Sync/Event Monitor**
   - Economic calendar integration
   - News impact analysis
   - Event detection
   
6. **Pattern Identifier / ML Feedback**
   - Machine learning models
   - Pattern recognition
   - Feedback loops
   
7. **Backtester**
   - Historical performance analysis
   - Strategy validation
   - Parameter optimization
   
8. **Dashboard / Interface**
   - UI components
   - Visualization tools
   - Control interfaces
   
9. **Order Router / MT5 Connector**
   - MT5 API integration
   - Order execution
   - Real-time market data feeds
   
10. **Compliance Logger**
    - Audit trail generators
    - Regulatory compliance
    - Performance tracking

## ðŸ”„ IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Pre-Production Validation (CURRENT PHASE)
1. Verify all existing modules against core domains
2. Ensure 100% EventBus connectivity maintained
3. Validate real-time MT5 data integration (no mock data)
4. Verify FTMO compliance enforcement

### Phase 2: Production Integration
1. Set up structured logging for production with timestamps
2. Implement continuous self-validation hooks
3. Deploy hierarchical kill switches for emergency protection
4. Configure production telemetry dashboards

### Phase 3: Live Trading Deployment
1. Implement phased trading volume approach
2. Configure drawdown monitoring with real-time alerts
3. Set up continuous feedback loop for strategy adaptation
4. Deploy 24/7 monitoring system

## ðŸš¨ COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT

All modifications and improvements must adhere to:
- Zero tolerance for simplification, duplication, or orphaned modules
- Full EventBus integration for all communication
- Real MT5 data only (no mock data, test stubs or fallbacks)
- FTMO rules enforcement (5% daily loss cap, 10% trailing drawdown)
- Real-time telemetry and event monitoring

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS TRACKING

Every change will be tracked with:
```python
# [GENESIS_AGENT_LOG] [Action] [Module_X] [Details]
# Timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM EEST
# Reason: [Justification]
```

Updates will be logged to:
1. `build_tracker.md` - For human-readable progress
2. `orchestration_log.json` - For machine-readable status

## ðŸ§ª INTEGRATION TESTING APPROACH

All modules will include testing hooks:
```python
def test_integration_[component]_to_[component]:
    # Set up test scenario with real MT5 data
    # Validate end-to-end behavior
    # Verify compliance with FTMO rules
```

## ðŸ”’ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before proceeding to live trading:
1. âœ… 100% module connectivity via EventBus
2. âœ… Zero mock data usage across system
3. âœ… Complete FTMO compliance implementation
4. âœ… All modules registered in module_registry.json
5. âœ… All connections mapped in system_tree.json
6. âœ… All telemetry hooks active and reporting

**Implementation Status:** READY FOR DEPLOYMENT  
**Current Build:** ARCHITECT_MODE_V7_COMPLIANCE_ACHIEVED  
**Next Steps:** Execute Phase 1 validation against trading modules
